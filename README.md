## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Flexbox, Grid. 

Used flexbox for navbar and grid for layout. 

## Lessons Learned:

Grid made setting up the portfolio area composed of pictures which were of various sizes very simple and intutive. I defined grid areas so I could specify position and size in the x, y dimensions.
